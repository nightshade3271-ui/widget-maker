How to run it while developing: If you want to keep coding and see the changes in the desktop app window instead of the browser, run this command in your terminal:

bash
npm run electron-dev
How to build a new version: If you make changes and want to create a new installer for yourself or others, run:

bash
npm run pack-app
(This will create a new 
.exe
 in the dist folder).
